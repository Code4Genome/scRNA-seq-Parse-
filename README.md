Parse Biosciences technology offers several key advantages for single-cell sequencing, including increased scalability, enhanced flexibility with sample fixation, and simplified workflows. 
It allows researchers to fix and store samples, then run them together in a single workflow, enabling large-scale experiments without the limitations of traditional microfluidics-based approaches. 
Also, this technology also provides combinatorial barcoding to process up to 96 samples or one million cells in a single experiment and the compatibility with both short- and long-read applications.
It offers high-quality data, long-term sample storage, and reduced time-course experiments
